# DSO Data Dashboard

## Overview
This is a project I worked on to display data about DSO (Dental Service Organizations) in a easily digestable way. 

## How to run
After cloning the repo, first run `npm init`, then run `npm start`

## Going forward
I'd like to add more features to the dashboard, such as the ability to compare deals by size and sponsor, as well as graph certain data over time. Additionally, I'd like to use NLP to gather more numerical information about each deal that is stored in the deal's description.

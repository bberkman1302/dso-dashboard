# DSO Data Dashboard

## Overview
This is a project I worked on to display data gathered about DSOs (Dental Service Organizations) in a easily digestable way. 

## How to run
After cloning the repo, first run `npm install`, then run `npm start`

## Going forward
I'd like to add more features to the dashboard, such as the ability to compare deals by size and sponsor, as well as graph certain data points over time. Additionally, I'd like to use some NLP tools to gather more numerical information about each deal that is stored in the deal's description.
